            <h2>  Father of the Indian nuclear program.</h2>
            <p>Homi Jehangir Bhabha, FNI,[3] FASc,[1] FRS[4](30 October 1909 to 24 January 1966) 
                was an Indian nuclear physicist who is widely credited as the "father of the 
                Indian nuclear programme". He was the founding director and professor of physics
                 at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), as well as the founding 
                 director of the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) which was renamed 
                 the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honour. TIFR and AEET served as the 
                 cornerstone to the Indian nuclear energy and weapons programme. He was the first
                  chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission and secretary of the Department 
                  of Atomic Energy. By supporting space science projects which initially derived 
                  their funding from the AEC, he played an important role in the birth of the 
                  Indian space programme.</p>
